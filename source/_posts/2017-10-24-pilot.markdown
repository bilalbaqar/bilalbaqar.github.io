Setting up a blog using Octopress.

Reasons for starting a tech blog:

 - I like to document everything I do in terms of tech so that I wont have a difficulty picking it up later on. Why keep them private if (maybe) they might be of help to someone. 

Reasons for using Octopress:

 - No hosting hassle due to excellent github pages support
